They don’t need a fancy title or a famous brand behind them to prove their worth.\n\nI've seen the other side too—people in top-tier companies feeling lost, overwhelmed, or stuck, even though the world sees them as 'successful'.\n\nLet’s stop attaching someone’s value to the company they work for.

  		"text": "One thing I see often in interviews. Big red flag:\n\nWhen you show up for a job interview, whether you’re a fresher or a C-level leader, please don’t start with \"what the company should do.\"\n\nAn interview is not a consulting session.\n\nIt’s a conversation. And curiosity always beats advice.\n\nRed flags I notice instantly:\n\n1. Not really listening\n2. Jumping into advice mode\n3. Thinking about the answer before the question is even finished\n4. No curiosity about the business, people, or context\n5. Answering everything too fast. If you never pause and think even once, you sound like a bot\n\nGreen flags that stand out:\n\n1. Be a great listener\n2. Set the agenda and respect time\n3. Keep it conversational, like you’re talking to another human\n4. Sell yourself without trying to sell\n5. Ask thoughtful questions. That only happens when you’ve actually read and understood the company\n\nStrong interviews aren’t about sounding smart. They’re about showing judgment, curiosity, and self-awareness.",

  		"text": "What Google Interviews Taught Me!\n\nBehind every \"Offer Accepted\" post you see on your feed, there are often dozens of emails just like this one in the archive. It’s easy to post offer letters. It’s much harder to post the \"No\" but a \"No\" often teaches you more than a \"Yes\" ever could.\n\nI gave three rounds for the University Grad (2026 Batch) role at Google. I didn’t get the offer. I remember staring at the email: \"Not moving forward.\" Honestly, it stung. I questioned my preparation. I questioned my skills.\n\nBut looking back, I realize I walked away with lessons that changed how I approach engineering.\n\nHere are a few key lessons I took from my Google interview experience:\n\n1. In Round 1, I saw a familiar Binary Tree problem similar to a LeetCode Hard I had solved before. But the interviewer added a variation that made it significantly tougher. If I had simply memorized the code, I would have failed instantly. Because I understood the core concept, I was able to solve the variation.\n\nThe lesson: Never memorize solutions. Memorization will not help you pass interviews. When you practice, do not just solve problems, try to solve variations. That is where real confidence comes from.\n\n2. \"Vocal Debugging\" sounded new to me until my interview. During Round 3, I was not allowed to write code or even use a pen for the first 15 minutes. I had to run a complex greedy algorithm entirely in my head and predict the output array.\n\nThe lesson: We practice on screens and paper, but we rarely practice mental compilation. Try doing dry runs in your head. It forces you to visualize data flow and builds raw logical strength.\n\n3. I faced situational questions around teamwork and ownership in both Round 2 and Round 3. Many candidates either try to memorize answers or ignore this part completely. I realized you should not script answers, but you must have a framework. Under pressure, it is very hard to structure a clear story if you have not organized your thoughts beforehand.\n\nThe lesson: You can be a great coder, but if you cannot communicate your thought process or explain how you handle failure, you will not clear the bar. In big tech, soft skills are hard skills.\n\nHope this adds some value to your journey.\n\nFor the full technical breakdown of the questions and rounds, check my previous post here: https://lnkd.in/gguehKN9\n\n#google #interviewexperience #softwareengineering #interviewlearnings #dsa #engineeringjourney #growthmindset #universitygrad #techcareers",
